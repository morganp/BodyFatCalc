BodyFatCalc
===========

Body Fat as a percentage can be calculated in various ways. The simplest is BMI, other more accurate measurments are taken using skin folds (measumernts in millimeters).

This library aims to make it easy to calculate the different formulas. Depending on which measurments you have taken will depend on which formulas you can calculate.
